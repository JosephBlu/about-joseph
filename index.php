		<h2>I'll tell you the story of my life...</h2>
		<p> My name is Joseph Ramirez. I am an easy going guy and yet an ambitious and competitive kind of person, but I always tend to be patient and calm. Stress is something that very rarely gets to me, but when it does I exhale and carry on and try to get over the obstacle. After all, I never put myself through stress situations unless there is a goal i have in mind.  </p>
		<p>I have alot of interests that I like to talk and learn about, such as cars, Fine Art, music, photography, or learning new skills or trades that i find interesting. </p>

		<p>Above all, my biggest interest these days is my daughter. EmmaBlu is such a life changer for me and my single greatest motivator to constantly improve myself.  </p>
