		<h1>If you have five seconds to spare,</h1>
		<h2>I'll tell you the story of my life...</h2>
		<p> My name is Joseph Ramirez. My favorite color is pink. I am <strike>an easy going guy and yet </strike>an ambitious and competitive kind of person, and I always tend to be <strike>patient and calm</strike>loud and obnoxious. Stress is something that <strike>very rarely</strike> always gets to me, but when it does I scream and try to kill the offending person. I never put myself through stress situations unless there is a goal I have in mind.  </p>

			I have a lot of interests that I like to talk and learn about, such as cars, Fine Art, music, photography, or learning new skills or trades that I find interesting.
		Above all, my biggest interest these days is my daughter. EmmaBlu is such a life changer for me and my single greatest motivator to constantly improve myself. 	 </p>
